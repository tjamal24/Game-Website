    <p>
      The goal of the game is to turn off all the lights on the grid. 
      Each square represents a light that can either be on (yellow) or off (dark).
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you click a square, the light you clicked turns off, along with the adjacent lights (above, below, left, and right).
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep clicking until all the lights are off!
